Example code of webscraping several Texas counties at one time using Python, SQL and selenium to manipulate search engines

In typical webscraping the python extension, REQUESTS, can be used to do most work.  Texas has javascript based search so an alternative method needed to be used.  

This code uses alpha characters to exhaust a search on property owner names.  And because the search is limited to finite amount of records, we add additional letters as needed.
